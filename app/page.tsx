                We are a builder-centric movement focused on advocacy and best practices for decentralized communities through a number of avenues, each pursued in parallel. 
              </p>
              <p className="uppercase">
                Specifically, we direct our efforts at (i) formulating and advocating for the development of clear and well-tailored policies and regulation that advance best practices in crypto while protecting the values of openness, transparency, and decentralization; (ii) developing best practices as well as crypto native solutions (self-help and self regulatory practices); and (iii) developing model legal standards and structures to support our regulatory engagement work. 
              </p>
              <p className="uppercase">
                We are founded on the belief that lawyers have both a role and duty to contribute to the open source movement as it is incumbent upon us all as members of builder-communities to be active in shaping narratives and advocating for smart policy outcomes.
